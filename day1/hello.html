    <h1> What is Compound ?</h1>
    <p1> <b>When two or more elements chemically combine in a fixed ratio by mass, the obtained product is known as a compound.</b> Compounds can be defined as substances consisting of 2 or more different types of elements in a fixed ratio of their atoms. When the elements combine, some individual property of the elements is lost and the newly formed compound has new properties.</p1>
    <br/>
    <p2> <b>Chemical Formula:</b> Compounds are represented by their chemical formula. A chemical formula is a symbolic representation of the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound.</p2>
    <p3>The chemical formula of water is  H<sub>2</sub>O which shows two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of Oxygen have combined to form one molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O. The chemical formula for common salt is NaCl which shows one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine combine to form one molecule of NaCl.</p4>
